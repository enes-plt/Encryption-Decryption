# Encryption-Decryption

Encryption-Decryption Project via Java

This Java program is a simple encryption and decryption tool based on a substitution cipher technique.
It includes a main class that introduces the concept of a one-time password (OTP) and an EncryptionProgram class that manages the encryption and decryption operations.
The program utilizes ASCII characters for manipulation and provides methods to generate a new encryption key, display the current key, encrypt messages, decrypt messages, and quit the program.
Users can input messages to be encrypted or decrypted, and the program continuously prompts for actions until the user chooses to quit.
Overall, it offers a basic demonstration of encryption and decryption functionalities in Java, suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced encryption implementations.
